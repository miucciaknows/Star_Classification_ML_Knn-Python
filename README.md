## Star "Classification" using Machine Learning in Python

This is some experimental notebooks utilizing unsupervised machine learning algorithms to "distinguish" stars in images.

In the `./Star_Classification` directory, there are several notebooks named by the algorithms used. Each notebook contains a detailed explanation of the step-by-step process followed during the experiment.
